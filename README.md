## Project Overview

This project implements the k-means clustering algorithm from scratch and applies it to Airbnb listings in Tokyo to explore how price, accommodation type, and geographic location interact in an urban short-term rental market.

## Key Skills Demonstrated

- Implemented k-means clustering from scratch without external ML libraries
- Data cleaning and preprocessing of real-world datasets
- Exploratory data analysis and cluster interpretation
- Geospatial visualisation using latitude and longitude
- Reproducible analysis using Python and Jupyter Notebook

## Methodology

- Implemented k-means clustering using Euclidean distance, centroid updates, and convergence checks
- Used latitude, longitude, and price as clustering features
- Cleaned and standardised price and coordinate data
- Applied clustering with k = 4 and a fixed random seed for reproducibility

## Results & Insights

- Identified clear price stratification across clusters
- The highest-priced cluster consisted of a very small number of listings concentrated in the densest urban area
- Lower-priced clusters showed wider geographic dispersion and greater room-type diversity
- Spatial visualisation revealed strong central clustering of high-price listings
